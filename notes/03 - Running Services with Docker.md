03 - Running Services with Docker


# Issues

Running our app right now makes big assumptions about our environment
Running our app requires precise knowledge of how to start it (npm start)


# Why Docker?
Docker solves both these issues

Containers wrap up everything that is needed for a program + how to start and run it


# Why Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a tool for running a bunch of different containers We give it some configuration to describe how we want our containers to run and interact with each other


# Dockerizing the Posts Service

Here is the format of the Dockerfile:

| INSTRUCTION | arguments        | Comment                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| FROM        | node:alpine      | Specify base image                                   |
| WORKDIR     | /app             | Set the working directory to '/app' in the container |
| COPY        | package.json ./  | Copy over only the package.json file                 |
| RUN         | npm install      | Install all dependencies                             |
| COPY        | ./ ./            | Copy over all of our remaining source code           |
| CMD         | ["npm", "start"] | Set the command to run when the container starts up  |
