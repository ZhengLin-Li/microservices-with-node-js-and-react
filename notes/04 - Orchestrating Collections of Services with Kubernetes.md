Docker images: think of them as blueprints, for example a blueprint for creating a cow.

Docker daemon: think of it as corral for letting the cows run wild.

Docker swarm (and Kubernetes): think of it as a rancher that manages the cows.

| kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl_name] | Get a deployment to restart all pods.  Will use latest version of an image if the pod spec has a tag of 'latest' |





# Introducing Deployments
Whenever I create a kubernetes deployment,  it will auto download image from docker hub?

- It depends on the ImagePullPolicy of the Pod
- The default pull policy is IfNotPresent
- It will try to download the image if itâ€™s not already present on the node


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: posts-depl
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: posts
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: posts
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: posts
          image: zhenglinli9875/posts:0.0.1
```

| kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl_name] | Get a deployment to restart all pods.  Will use latest version of an image if the pod spec has a tag of 'latest' |




# Updating Deployments - Method #1
- Step 1 - Make a change to your project code
- Step 2 - Rebuild the image, specifying a new image version
- Step 3 - In the deployment config file, update the version of the image
- Step 4 - Run the command: kubectl apply -f [depl file name]


# Preferred Method for Updating Deployments - Method #2
- Step 1 - The deployment must be using the 'latest' tag in the pod spec section
  - image: chesterheng/posts:latest or 
  - image: chesterheng/posts
- Step 2 - Make an update to your code
- Step 3 - Build the image
- Step 4 - Push the image to docker hub

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cluster IP        | Sets up an easy-to-remember URL to access a pod. Only exposes pods in the cluster                            |
| Node Port         | Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster.  Usually only used for dev purposes                         |
| Load Balancer     | Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster.  This is the right way to expose a pod to the outside world |
| External Name     | Redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url.....don't worry about this one....                            |
