# React Project Setup

Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. not a technology in itself. web applications are able to make quick, incremental updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser page. 

XMLHttpRequest: XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.

axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js; Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser; Make http requests from node.js

react: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

react-dom: React package for working with the DOM.

cors: Node.js CORS middleware; Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

nodemon: a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

body-parser: Node.js body parsing middleware.Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

crypto: Random bytes from browserify stand alone

async function: The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression.

useState: useState Hook from React. It lets us keep local state in a function component.

useEffect: run some additional code after React has updated the DOM
